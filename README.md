## Summary & Process
For this project, our objective was to create an app that dynamically generates a team summary with Node.js commands.

I began by drafting all of the constructor classes. Afterwards, I created the framework of inquirer prompts to ensure that all pertinent questions were asked. Once the functionality was complete, I took the liberty to add some Bootstrap styling which included adding responsive column sizes and background colors.
